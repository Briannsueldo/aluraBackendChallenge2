# Backend Challenge for Alura

In this project we have to make an application that can consume an API (Guntendex). And we use the api data to make an interactive menu for the user.

At first, the data will be consumed in the api but then it will be stored in a Postgresql database, for the next time we want to search the same input, we will query the database first, if it is not available in it, it will be consumed by the api and stored for future use.
